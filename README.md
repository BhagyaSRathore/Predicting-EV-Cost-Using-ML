# Predicting-EV-Cost-Using-ML
The project aims to predict Electric Vehicle (EV) range, cost, and sales using Machine Learning techniques. It integrates Generative AI tools like OpenAI, DALL·E, Gemini, and DeepSeek for chatbot and report generation, and uses Streamlit to build an interactive frontend for EV data visualization and prediction.

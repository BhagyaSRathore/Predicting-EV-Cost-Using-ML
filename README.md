# Predicting-EV-Cost-Using-ML
The project aims to predict Electric Vehicle (EV) range, cost, and sales using Machine Learning techniques. It integrates Generative AI tools like OpenAI, DALL·E, Gemini, and DeepSeek for chatbot and report generation, and uses Streamlit to build an interactive frontend for EV data visualization and prediction.

# 🚗 Predicting Electric Vehicle (EV) Cost, Range, and Sales Using Machine Learning and Generative AI

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive system to estimate the **cost**, **range**, and **sales** of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using **Machine Learning** techniques. It combines data analytics, predictive modeling, and **Generative AI** tools to create an interactive platform for users, researchers, and EV enthusiasts. The project also integrates a **Streamlit**-based frontend for user-friendly data visualization and prediction.

## 🧩 Objectives
1. Define the machine learning problem — predicting EV range, cost, and sales.
2. Collect and preprocess EV datasets from Kaggle and import into Jupyter Notebook.
3. Explore **Machine Learning algorithms** (Regression, Random Forest) for prediction.
4. Integrate **Generative AI APIs** for chatbot and automated reporting.
5. Develop a **Streamlit frontend** for real-time data input and EV prediction visualization.
6. Evaluate model performance using metrics such as MSE, MAE, and R² Score.

## 🧠 Learning Goals
- Understand **Supervised Learning** (Regression) and **Unsupervised Learning** (Clustering).  
- Learn the workflow of a machine learning project: data cleaning → EDA → model training → evaluation.  
- Explore **Generative AI APIs** (OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, DALL·E) for creative automation.  
- Build an end-to-end ML + AI-powered app using **Streamlit**.

## 📊 Dataset
**Dataset Used:** [Electric Vehicle Specifications and Prices - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihilhan/electric-vehicle-specifications-and-prices)  
The dataset includes attributes such as:
- Battery Capacity (kWh)
- Range (km)
- Efficiency / Consumption
- Make / Model
- Charging Power
- Price (Target Variable)

This dataset is ideal for regression modeling and feature-based cost prediction.
